# Navigation Interface Tests

Here you can find a small tester page for navigation behaviors in browsers.

`iframes.html` is the main tester page. It contains two levels of iframes in
which you can test navigation behaviors.

Nesting structure:

* iframes.html
  * nav_tester_with_frame.html
    * nav_tester.html

Each page includes `nav_tester.js`, which generates the test UI.
